## The Problem

The Nautilus DevOps team has recently setup a Jenkins server, which they want to use for some CI/CD jobs. Before that they want to install some plugins which will be used in most of the jobs. Please find below more details about the task

1. Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and Adm!n321 password.

2. Once logged in, install the Git and GitLab plugins. Note that you may need to restart Jenkins service to complete the plugins installation, If required, opt to Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre.

Note:

1. After restarting the Jenkins service, wait for the Jenkins login page to reappear before proceeding.

2. For tasks involving web UI changes, capture screenshots to share for review or consider using screen recording software like loom.com for documentation and sharing.

## The Solution

This is going to be a hard one to really put into a text document without a load of pictures. I did it in the GUI because I'm not about to try and learn Jenkins CLI. Maybe in the future, but not now. 

Anyway, I signed in with the crententials provided then navigated to 'Manage Jenkins' > 'Pluggins' > 'Available Plugins' then searched got Git. Ticked the box then installed that. I did also specify to '
Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running'.

I then did this again but with GitLab and thats kind of it.

## Thoughts and takeaways

I've never used Jenkins before this but that wasnt particularly challenging :smile: it felt pretty self explanitory. Like all these challenges, I'm sure its going to get a lot harder. Time for tea.
