# 100 Days of DevOps by KodeKloud

I've been trying to learn alot more about DevOps and the key assocaited tools (Linux, Git, Docker, Terraform etc) and stumbled upon this course. 

I know I have a bit of a weakness in bash scripting so I have decided today (51 days in) to go back and try to build bash scripts for every days challange. 

I believe this will be a great way to improve my bash scripting and refresh all the topics covered so far.
