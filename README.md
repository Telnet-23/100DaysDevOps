## 100 Days of DevOps by KodeKloud

Lately, I've been deepening my understanding of DevOps and the essential tools that underpin it, including Linux, Git, Docker, Terraform, and Kubernetes. As part of this journey, I recently discovered a promising course.

To strengthen my Bash scripting abilities and build a repository of practical scripts, I’ve decided—51 days into the course—to revisit and tackle as many of the previous tasks as possible by developing scripts, Dockerfiles, and related artifacts. This approach should reinforce my Bash skills and consolidate everything I've learned so far.

For context, I use Fedora as my primary Linux distribution, and all scripts are tailored with RHEL-based systems in mind.
