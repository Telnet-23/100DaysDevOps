## 100 Days of DevOps by KodeKloud

Lately, I've been deepening my understanding of DevOps and the essential tools that underpin it, including Linux, Git, Docker, Terraform, and Kubernetes. As part of this journey, I recently discovered a promising course.

To strengthen my Bash scripting abilities and build a repository of practical scripts and self reference guides, I’ve decided 53 days into the course to revisit and tackle as many of the previous tasks as possible by developing scripts, Dockerfiles, and related artifacts. This approach should reinforce my Bash skills and consolidate everything I've learned so far.

For context, I use Fedora as my primary Linux distribution, and all scripts are tailored with RHEL-based systems in mind.

I have now finished all the challenges in this course but I'm still adding tasks from 'pre-repo' as the first 50 odd days are missing.
